# emubayer
Bayer CFA camera emulator that takes a "picture" of a provided PNG image and saves the result as a DNG file.

## Purposes
With this tool, it becomes easy to test debayering algorithms in any scenario, as it no longer becomes neccesary to use a real camera to capture photos and store it in a DNG file. Only a simple PNG file is needed to emulate a DNG photo capture, in any pattern (RGGB, BGGR, GRBG or GBRG).

## Use
Just run emubayer via terminal, the executable contains help messages so that the user can use it proficiently.
